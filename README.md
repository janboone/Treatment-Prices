# Treatment-Prices


This paper shows that it is possible for intermediate goods to be priced above the value that the good has for final consumers. This happens in sectors selling to markets with adverse selection problems, where the cost difference between consumer types is dominated by their elasticity difference. High input prices then help to separate consumer types and reduce information rents. We use the example of pharmaceutical companies selling drugs to a health insurance market at prices exceeding value. Another feature of the model is an excessive private incentive to reduce market size, e.g. in the form of personalized medicine.
